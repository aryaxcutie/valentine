<h1>I Love You 💖</h1>

<p>
I don't just love you for big dramatic reasons.  
I love you in small quiet ways.  
In the way you reply even when you're tired.  
In the way you pretend not to care but actually care too much.  

You have become my habit.  
My comfort place.  
My soft spot.  

When something good happens, I want to tell you.  
When something bad happens, I want you near.  

I don't know what the future holds…  
But if I get to choose,  
I choose you.  
Again and again.  
In every mood.  
In every version of you.
</p>
